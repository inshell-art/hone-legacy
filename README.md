# Hone: A Minimalist Editor to Polish Ideas into Principles

## Project Status

This repository is deprecated and archived. Firebase Hosting for the app has been disabled; the source remains available for reference only.

Hone is a minimalist writing app for facets and articles. A facet is a titled idea (a line that starts with `$`). Articles collect facets and the narrative between them so you can revisit, refine, and hone your thinking.

## Key Features

- **Facets and articles**: Facet titles are the only formatting; everything else is plain text.
- **Slash commands**: Type `/` at the start of a line to open the palette.
  - `/create` inserts a `$` facet title.
  - `/update` saves the current facet to the library.
  - `/publish` snapshots the current article as an immutable edition (v1, v2, ...).
  - `/hone` inserts another facet into the current one.
- **Immutable editions**: Each publish creates a versioned snapshot with stable URLs (`/a/:articleId/v/:version`).
- **Honed from blocks**: Honed inserts are wrapped as:
  - `--- honed-from: <id> | <title> | <timestamp> ---`
  - `--- end honed-from ---`
- **Facet library**: The Facets tab lists updated time and a "Honed from" history with similarity scores.
- **Local-first**: Data lives in your browser LocalStorage. Import/Export is available in the footer.

npm run test:coverage # Cypress E2E + coverage report
```

## Usage Tips

- Start a facet by typing `$` at the start of a line or using `/create`.
- Update a facet by placing the caret inside it, then type `/` at line start and choose `/update`.
- Publish an article by typing `/` at the start of a line and choosing `/publish`.
- Hone a facet the same way with `/hone`, then pick a facet from the list.

## Storage and Privacy
